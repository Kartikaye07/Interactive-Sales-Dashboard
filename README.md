# Insight on Sales: Interactive Pizza Sales Dashboard

### Project Overview:
This project is aimed at analyzing pizza sales data and identifying related trends and insights. 
The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the impact of several factors, such as day of the week, time, pizza size, category, etc.

### Business Case:
The business case for this project is to help pizza joints improve their sales numbers by analyzing several parameters. 
Through this analysis, they can identify trends and patterns, and implement targeted data-driven decisions to increase their revenue.

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze sales data of pizzas by joints. 
By doing so, the project aims to facilitate a more streamlined decision-making process, and ultimately increase the revenue generated.

## KPIs:
1. Primary KPI:
  - Maximization of total revenue generated.

2. Secondary KPI
  - Discontinuation/betterment of practices and products that are not income-generative.

## Task carried out

### 1. Getting dataset from the client (The dataset used in this project was taken from Kaggle)

  Data was taken from Kaggle in the Pizza Restaurant Sales challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales
  
Data is also available in the google drive link below:
  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Z28H5MtN41X3UOS0jFcNeTYr-QO27XFr

### 2. Understanding the Business Case

  KPIs were studied with respect to the dataset, some of the questions tackled in this project were as follows:
  - What days and times tend to be busiest?
  - How many pizzas are being sold during peak periods?
  - What are the best and worst-selling pizzas?
  - What's the average order value?
  - What's the average number of pizzas per order?

### 3. Data Cleaning

  Duplication was removed, columns and rows adjusted.

  Preview of some sections of the cleaned datasheet:

### 4. Data Processing 
  Some additional details were extracted from the cleaned data to help with data analysis, for example, day-wise data was added
  to help with analysis as the client (in this case Kaggle's problem statement) requested for the day-wise trend.
  
Included columns:

### 5. Data Analysis and Visualization (using pivot tables and charts)

  Pivot tables and pivot charts were created across different sheets with respect to achieving the KPIs. 
  Thereafter, a Data Analysis Showcase Sheet was created housing all the pivot tables earlier created for data analysis.

### 6. Creation of a dynamic and interactive dashboard

  The dashboard was made interactive and dynamic by creating a filter panel using a timeline and slicer that adjusts the data of the piot tables and provides the necessary insights for making data-drived decisions
